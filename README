This module a simple file-based database.  This database simply contains
IP blocks as keys, and countries as values.  The data contains all
public IP addresses and should be more
complete and accurate than reverse DNS lookups.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest mirror,
or to analyze your web server logs, or
to determine the countries of your visitors.

To install, see the INSTALL file.

To find a country for an IP address, this module uses the database
contained in /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat to find a Network
that contains the IP address.
