1.11  November 1st 2003

The following changes contributed by Graham Barr

* The "I1" template for unpack is machine dependent. It seems to be 
that you generate the GeoIP.dat file on a little-endian machine. This 
causes everything to fail on a big-endian machine. The patch changes 
unpack to use "V1", which will unpack a little-endian integer and be 
platform independent.

* The in-memory cache was causing the buffer to be copied several 
times. The patch causes the data to be read directly into the hash and 
also avoids copying in _seek_country

* Tests 1_lookup.t and 2_namelookup.t fail if there is no GeoIP.dat 
file in /usr/local. The patch makes these tests skip if GeoIP.dat 
cannot be found.
